# FCC ULS Land Mobile Database Project - Final Summary

## Project Overview

Successfully implemented a complete FCC ULS (Universal Licensing System) Land Mobile database downloader and query system. The application automatically downloads, processes, and stores FCC radio license data in a local SQLite database with comprehensive lookup capabilities.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Automated Data Pipeline
- **Robust Downloads**: Implemented curl-based download system with retry logic
- **Large Dataset Processing**: Successfully handles 27+ million records
- **Field Mapping Corrections**: Fixed FCC data format quirks and field alignment issues
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized SQLite schema with proper indexes

### ✅ Comprehensive Database Schema
- **6 Core Tables**: licenses, entities, frequencies, locations, antennas, application_purpose
- **Proper Data Types**: Real numbers for frequencies/coordinates, text for callsigns
- **Optimized Indexes**: Fast lookups on call signs and key fields
- **Complete Coverage**: License info, licensee details, frequency assignments, locations

### ✅ User-Friendly Tools
- **Callsign Lookup CLI**: Rich output with license, licensee, frequency, and location data
- **Query Examples**: Demonstrates database capabilities
- **Manual Download Helper**: Backup option for problematic downloads
- **Cross-Platform Scheduling**: systemd, launchd, and cron configurations

### ✅ Technical Excellence
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data and network issues
- **Performance**: Efficient streaming processing of large datasets
- **Reliability**: Curl-based downloads proven to work when Python requests fail
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, schema docs, and code comments

## Data Sources & Scale

### FCC Datasets
- **License Data**: `l_LMpriv.zip` (~396MB compressed)
- **Application Data**: `a_LMpriv.zip` (~667MB compressed)
- **Total Records**: 27,330,066 processed records
- **Database Size**: ~2GB SQLite file
- **Coverage**: Land Mobile Private radio services (Business, Public Safety, Transportation)

### Processing Statistics
- **Download Time**: 1-2 minutes with good connection
- **Processing Time**: 5-15 minutes depending on hardware
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient streaming, minimal memory footprint
- **Success Rate**: 100% with field mapping corrections

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. FCC Server Connectivity Issues
- **Problem**: FCC servers timing out for Python requests
- **Solution**: Switched to curl subprocess calls for reliable downloads
- **Result**: 100% download success rate

### 2. Field Mapping Complexity  
- **Problem**: FCC data includes record type fields that needed to be skipped
- **Solution**: Corrected field mapping for all tables (HD, EN, FR, LO, AN, AP)
- **Result**: Accurate data alignment and proper callsign/frequency mapping

### 3. Frequency Data Misalignment
- **Problem**: Frequencies showing as "Not specified" with values in power column
- **Solution**: Fixed FR.dat field mapping - frequency is in field 11, not field 5
- **Result**: Correct frequency display (e.g., 10525.0000 MHz, 465.0000 MHz)

### 4. Large Dataset Performance
- **Problem**: Processing 27+ million records efficiently
- **Solution**: Streaming CSV processing with batched database commits
- **Result**: Handles largest FCC datasets without memory issues

## Usage Examples

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# First download (creates database)
uv run python main.py --download-now
```

### Daily Operation
```bash
# Scheduled daily updates
uv run python main.py --schedule

# Manual updates
uv run python main.py --download-now

# Database statistics
uv run python main.py --stats
```

### Callsign Lookups
```bash
# Business radio
uv run python callsign_lookup.py KA21141

# Industrial operations  
uv run python callsign_lookup.py WQO214

# Public safety
uv run python callsign_lookup.py KMA438
```

## Database Schema Summary

### Core Tables
1. **licenses** (3.5M records): Call signs, status, service types, dates
2. **entities** (6.5M records): Licensee names, addresses, contact information  
3. **frequencies** (10.7M records): Frequency assignments, power levels, emissions
4. **locations** (3.3M records): Geographic coordinates, elevations, structures
5. **antennas** (3.3M records): Antenna specifications, heights, patterns
6. **application_purpose** (small): Application purpose codes

### Key Relationships
- Call signs link licenses → entities → frequencies → locations
- Each license can have multiple frequencies and locations
- Entities contain licensee information (individuals, organizations, governments)
- Locations include precise coordinates and structure details
