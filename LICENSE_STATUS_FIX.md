# License Status & Dates Fix - August 18, 2025

## Issue
After database rebuild, Grant Date, Expiration Date, and License Status were showing as "Not available" or "Unknown" for many callsigns, even though the data existed in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by poor SQL query ordering. When multiple license records exist for the same callsign, the `LIMIT 1` queries were returning random records - often ones with empty license_status, grant_date, and expired_date fields instead of the complete records.

### Example Issue
For callsign WIM449:
- **12 total records** in the licenses table
- **10 records** had empty license_status, grant_date, expired_date
- **2 records** had complete data: Status "A", Grant Date "08/12/2025", Expiration "11/02/2035"
- **Query returned** one of the empty records randomly

## Solution
Added intelligent `ORDER BY` clauses to prioritize complete records:

```sql
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN license_status IS NOT NULL AND license_status != '' 
             AND grant_date IS NOT NULL AND grant_date != '' THEN 1
        WHEN license_status IS NOT NULL AND license_status != '' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END,
    expired_date DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This ensures:
1. **Priority 1**: Records with both license_status AND dates
2. **Priority 2**: Records with license_status but missing dates  
3. **Priority 3**: Records with missing license_status
4. **Tie-breaker**: Most recent expiration date

## Files Fixed

### 1. enhanced_lookup.py
- Updated license query around line 93
- Now prioritizes complete license records

### 2. webapp/app.py  
- Updated license query around line 35
- Flask web app now shows correct license info

### 3. callsign_lookup.py
- Updated license query around line 94
- Legacy lookup tool also fixed

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```
Call Sign:        WIM449
Status:           ✅ Unknown ()
Grant Date:       Not available  
Expiration:       Not available
```

### After Fix:
```
Call Sign:        WIM449
Status:           ✅ Active
Grant Date:       08/12/2025
Expiration:       11/02/2035
```

## Verification
- ✅ Enhanced lookup tool: Working correctly
- ✅ Legacy lookup tool: Working correctly  
- ✅ Flask web app: Working correctly
- ✅ Multiple callsigns tested: All showing proper data

## Prevention
This fix ensures that:
- Future database rebuilds won't have this issue
- The most complete and recent license data is always displayed
- All three lookup interfaces show consistent information

## Impact
- **User Experience**: License information now displays correctly
- **Data Accuracy**: Shows the most current and complete license status
- **Consistency**: All lookup tools now return the same accurate data
